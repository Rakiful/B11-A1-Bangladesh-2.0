                <p>Dr. Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, economist, and Nobel Laureate, is celebrated for pioneering microfinance and microcredit, which empower impoverished individuals by providing small loans without requiring collateral. Born in 1940, he founded Grameen Bank in 1983, revolutionizing the fight against poverty by enabling marginalized communities, especially women, to start small businesses. Dr. Yunus advocates for social business as a means to address global issues like unemployment, education, and health. His transformative ideas have inspired worldwide initiatives aimed at economic inclusion and social impact. In 2006, he and Grameen Bank jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts.</p>
